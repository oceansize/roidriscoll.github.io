            <p>Since embarking on my programming journey, I have to admit - I have gone a
little gem-crazy. It&rsquo;s just so EASY to type &lsquo;gem install the_promise_of_magic&rsquo;.
I think that&rsquo;s one of the more dangerous aspects of living in the command line.
When I&rsquo;m considering installing something via the browser, there are a multitude
of clues to help you ascertain whether or not a binary is legit, not least how
polished their site looks.</p>

<p>There is also a kind of false sense of security that can set in when you&rsquo;ve been
a Mac user for your entire adult life, and have not traditionally had much cause
to worry about virus issues etc- so to just type three words into your iTerm and
wait for your latest library to make itself comfortable in your filesystem takes
little effort. This is something I have noticed and am now very mindful of - but
I digress&hellip;</p>

<p>This post is really to draw your attention to a frankly wonderful wee gem I
found this week, called &lsquo;Seeing Is Believing&rsquo;, developed by <a href="http://joshcheek.com/seeing_is_believing">Mr Josh
Cheek</a>. Based on an existing gem
called <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/rcodetools">rcodetools</a>, it automagically
places a comment at the end of each line of ruby code containing the evaluation.
Pretty friggin' useful for a beginner. You can see a video of this little beaut
being demonstrated <a href="http://vimeo.com/73866851">here</a>.</p>

<p>So how could this be even better Roi? How about Sublime Text integration? <a href="https://github.com/JoshCheek/sublime-text-2-seeing-is-believing">Ding
Dong!</a> (Josh
also supports Textmate 1-2 and Vim)</p>

<p>There is one wee-tiny-little catch - if you&rsquo;re new at this stuff, the
documentation is a little bit sparse (I found the whole rvm wrapper thing a bit
mysterious to say the least), so I thought I would do a quick write-up. Now bear
in mind that I work with a ruby version of 2.1.1 on a mac using rvm <a href="https://rvm.io/rvm/basics">Ruby
Version Manager</a> so I can only tell you what worked
for me, and this is it.</p>

<p>First one must install the gem:
<code>
gem install seeing_is_believing
</code>
Then you need to navigate to the following folder:
<code>
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages
</code>
and inside of that directory, clone this repo:
<code>
git clone git://github.com/JoshCheek/sublime-text-2-seeing-is-believing.git
SeeingIsBelieving
</code>
If this is confusing for you, I would recommend researching into how to navigate
your file system using the <a href="http://learncodethehardway.org/cli/book/cli-crash-course.html">command
line</a> and basic
usage of <a href="https://try.github.io">Git</a>.
Next up, you need to make a wrapper for Sublime (this is the bit that I found
confusing), and for this you need to know which version of ruby you are
currently running. On my setup, I can type <code>ruby -v</code> and am rewarded with the
output:
<code>
ruby 2.1.1p76 (2014-02-24 revision 45161) [x86_64-darwin12.0]
</code>
I take the section <code>ruby 2.1.1</code> and type the following into Terminal:
<code>
rvm wrapper ruby-2.1.1 sublime
</code>
Now, at this point you need to run the following command in terminal : <code>which
sublime_ruby</code>, which will return a line like this:
<code>/Users/your-username/.rvm/bin/sublime_ruby</code>
At this point, you need to open &lsquo;SeeingIsBelieving/Seeing Is
Believing.sublime-settings&rsquo; in Sublime Text and comment out the line
<code>"RBENV_VERSION": "2.0.0-p0"</code> and the MOST important part: delete
<code>"ruby_command": "~/.rbenv/shims/ruby",</code> and replace with the following:</p>

<pre><code>"ruby_command": "~/.rvm/bin/sublime_ruby",
</code></pre>

<p>where the line <code>"~/.rvm/bin/sublime_ruby",</code> matches the line you got when you
typed in <code>which sublime_ruby</code> - remember that? ;)</p>

<p>Restart Sublime Text, and enter some ruby code:
<code>ruby
10.times do |i|
  i * 2
end
</code>
Now if you hit the pre-defined keyboard shortcut (⌥ + ⌘ + B on OS X) or run the
command:
<code>
Evaluate Ruby code with Seeing Is Believing
</code>
from your command pallete (⌘ + ⇧ + P), you should see the following output:
<code>
10.times do |i|
  i * 2          # =&gt; 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18
end              # =&gt; 10
</code>
To remove the comments, run <code>Remove Seeing Is Believing annotations</code> or press (⌥
+ ⌘ + V on OS X). And you are back to the original.</p>

<p>Well there you have it - instant win! I strongly suggest that you take the time
to watch Josh&rsquo;s video (and browse the documention I linked to earlier) - I have
directly referenced a lot of the material for this article and I cannot
recommend this enough as a tool to get your head around what ruby is doing when
it evaluates your code.</p>

<p>Happy coding! ^_^</p>
